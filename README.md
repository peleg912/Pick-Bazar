# Pick-Bazar

1. Please note that the search fitcher is working by clicking the search icon, and not by pressing the enter key.
2. I had one major problem that I still could not solve- For the search to work I had to disable one
   of the methods in another component (the problem is with Next's internal routing).
3. Please when you will finished the web view, go to "mobile/components/products-display/mobileCategoryProducts" and uncomment
   the methode in line 25 - This is the method I had to disable for the search to work.
   
Apologies for these issues,
Peleg.
